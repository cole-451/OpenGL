# Software Renderer (OpenGL)
[screenshot 1](Build/Assets/Screenshots/shot1.png)
Created for my GAT350 class. Uses OpenGL to render simple models, effects and shaders, while using ImGUI to control factors of the program in real-time.

## Key Features
* Utilizes ImGUI to allow runtime swapping of models, materials, and textures
* Also supports build-time setup via .JSON reading
* Multiple shaders using gorraud and Blinn-phong reflections
* Skybox
*Shadow mapping for objects
... and more!
